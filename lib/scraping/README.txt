SUP!

Let's scrape some datas :)))

This whole thing starts from the CHIPTUNES = WIN google sheet (http://tinyurl.com/nuqn2j5)

Here's a summary of the data

                    Name  Location  Website  Website2  Musical Focus
Sheet 1 Chiptunes    x        x        x         x
Sheet 2 Visualists   x        x        x         x
Sheet 3 VGM          x        x        x         x
Sheet 4 Nerdcore     x        x        x         x
Sheet 5 Netlabels    x        x        x                     x


AW COME ON.  Why the "musical focus" column?  Whatever.  Just put "chiptunes" as the musical focus for Chiptune artists, etc.

so

                    Name  Location  Website  Website2  Musical Focus
Sheet 1 Chiptunes    x        x        x         x       Chiptunes
Sheet 2 Visualists   x        x        x         x       Visualists
Sheet 3 VGM          x        x        x         x          VGM
Sheet 4 Nerdcore     x        x        x         x       Nerdcore
Sheet 5 Netlabels    x        x        x                     x

The first thing I'm going to do is take the website information and split it out into separate fields for:
 - soundcloud
 - twitter
 - facebook
 - bandcamp
 - personal site

The number 1 field I'm interested in is the artist's soundcloud, since that seems to be the most direct way to their music and soundcloud has a nce api.

However, I found that not many artists had a soundcloud listed on CHIPTUNES = WIN, which might be because it's too new.

BUT, most have a facebook, and on their facebook they link to their soundcloud... so I can still get it!
